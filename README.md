# Strong-Password-Generator

This program is a simple strong password generator made with the help of pyperclip and random libraries and was inspired by Fahmida Yesmin's tutorial: https://linuxhint.com/python-password-generator/

This strong password generator prompts the user for their desired paswword length and then generates a randomized password. To ensure the strength of the password, the generator forces the user to request a password length of 12 characters or more. If the user requestes a shorter length, they get an error message and are prompted to re-enter a bigger length.
